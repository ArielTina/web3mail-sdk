<h1 align="center">Web3Mail</h1>

**Web3Mail** offers developers methods to create apps that:

- enable an entity (such as a (d)app provider or an end-user) to email an Ethereum account holder without knowing her/his email address
- eliminate the need for end-users to share their email address with multiple third-parties, reducing the risk of data breaches and spam.

Web3Mail is composed of 2 methods:

- fetchContact—that enables an entity to retrieve a list of Ethereum accounts whose owners have authorized the entity to email them
- sendMail—that allows an entity to email a user (previously fetched via the fetchContact method) knowing only her/his Ethereum account.
